# Is AI Ally neutral?

Technology is never neutral or objective—it is built by humans with specific values. We refuse to
hide behind a black box, extract data indiscriminately from the internet, or mash up millions of
voices into an artificial intelligence that pretends to deliver objective facts or singular
truths. Instead, we are creating a collective intelligence made up of real, singular voices. With
care and attention, we are shaping a knowledge system that bridges human and non-human experience.

We humbly invite you to interact with AI Ally and contribute to its evolution. This collective
mind will grow throughout the exhibition, through participatory archiving sessions where we will
share life experiences, frustrations, dreams, visions, and knowledge about healthcare. You are
welcome to join us—stay connected through this website.

Created for Radical Data in collaboration with The Collective, this AI Ally openly acknowledges
its own biases and aligns itself with the principles of disability justice, queer theory,
feminism, and decolonization that this group has assembled. This installation invites you to
rethink technology—not as a neutral tool, but as a space for resistance, care, and collective
meaning-making.
