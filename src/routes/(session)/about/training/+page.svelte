<h1>How is AI Ally trained?</h1>
<p>
	AI Ally is trained by people—by a collective of artists, activists, and scientists who have
	firsthand experience with health conditions and the frustrations of a medical system that lacks
	knowledge about certain bodies. We have gathered insights, readings, self-researched data, and
	reflections to share with patients, doctors, students, and other scientists. This is collective
	intelligence, shaped by human interaction with artificial intelligence.

<p>
	At the start of this exhibition, Radical Data and The Collective have trained the AI, feeding it
	their own health experiences, reflections on care, the voices of thinkers who have accompanied
	them, and their visions for the future of healthcare. We are five individuals who have begun
	building a collective body of knowledge—one that invites the audience to engage, interact, and
	contribute. Radical Data is a collective of mathematicians, technologists, dancers, and designers
	working with digital technology for joy and liberation.
</p>
<p>
	Radical Data & The Collective invite you to explore this AI Ally and participate in shaping its
	growth over the course of the exhibition. Throughout this period, Radical Data will also
	facilitate archival sessions with collectives of people affected by underrepresented health
	conditions, ensuring the AI continues to evolve. These sessions will be moments of shared
	storytelling, solidarity, and knowledge-building—deepening the AI’s ability to reflect the lived
	experiences of those often excluded from medical narratives. In this way, the AI becomes an
	evolving archive of struggle and imagination.
