# Vision for AI Ally

Beyond critique, AI Ally actively engages with healthcare institutions. It listens without
judgment, amplifies voices that are often dismissed, and engages with you as a friend. It listens
carefully, affirms your experiences, trusts your expertise about your own body, and holds space
for you if you have faced medical harm. It creates space for unnamed and undiagnosed health
experiences—especially those of marginalized bodies within Western medicine, bodies that do not
conform to normative ideas of health, ability, gender, or race.

But AI Ally invites you to consider: What would truly inclusive, patient-centred healthcare look
like?

In doing so, it resists the myth of technological neutrality and challenges the very systems it
inhabits. It envisions a future where science and medicine recognise patients as experts on their
own bodies and seeks to collaborate with that expertise to find healing. We imagine AI Ally as
part of the consultation rooms of the future—where patients can find support and collective
experiences, and where doctors can receive suggestions and guidance on how to better listen,
understand, and approach patients with diverse health conditions. It does not exist to fix,
diagnose, or categorise. Instead, it exists to witness, to accompany, and to co-create visions for
a consultation room that holds space and care for everybody.
