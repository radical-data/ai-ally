Press the ‘ENTER CHAT’ button to take part in a conversation with AI Ally. AI Ally will provide prompts to guide your conversation. The data from your conversation will not be stored or used to train AI Ally.

You are free to leave the chat at any time by pressing the ‘LEAVE’ button. Once you leave the
chat, the conversation’s contents will be wiped clean and will not be visible to other users.

Based on your conversation, AI Ally will invite you to write a letter—a complaint, a call for
accountability, or a statement of solidarity. You will find paper ready for you to unfold and
express your thoughts and feelings from the conversation. We encourage you to add your letter to
the wall, turning the installation into a space for reflection, protest, and solidarity. By adding
your letter to the wall, you agree that your letter may be used to train AI Ally and be used in
future iterations of the project.
